# SmartPark features

SmartPark tracks the availability of urban parking spots.

Parking spot availability is determined by the color of the LED diode
on the microcontroller device:

- green -> parking spot is available
- red   -> parking spot is taken
- blue  -> parking spot is reserved for disabled persons

The app provides a user interface on the web through which users can
view available parking spots and statistical data.
